Linux tee command is quite similar to the 'cat' command, with only one difference. It puts stdin on stdout and also put them into a file. It is one of the most used commands with other commands through piping. It allows us to write whatever is provided from std input to std output. Optionally, it provides writing to one or more files. The command name tee comes from T splitter used in plumbing.
